Late 2000 I started to learn AUTOCAD and, then, I was introduced to a LISP
dialect called AUTOLISP. I used it to automate repetitive tasks when drawing
a telecommunication projects. After that. I got curious about computer
programming and I enrolled in an ASP/VBScript/PHP/JScript course.
Also, I bought a Java book and started to learn this new thing called OOP.
Back in the time, GNU/Linux got in my radar and I had to learn the basics to
start a career as a Network Analyst. However, I was still studying software
development by myself.
I learned a programming language called Python and, after some time working as
Sysadmin, I applied to a position as a Python Programer for a Linux
distribution called Mandriva, former Conectiva Linux.
After my journey at Mandriva, I got a position as a Backend Developer,
designing, architecting and developing REST APIs with microservices and
authentication/authorization solutions. My main learning was that at
mid-to-long term, without the proper architecture, the code will get coupled
to frameworks and technologies and the lead and circle time will, likely,
increase.
